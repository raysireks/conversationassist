# UI Verification Rules

- **Visual Confirmation Required**: When testing or verifying a UI component, NEVER rely solely on code analysis or successful build/test outputs.
- **Use Browser Tool**: You MUST use the `browser_subagent` (Chrome tool) to open the page and visually inspect the component.
- **Verify Appearance & Behavior**: Check that the component renders correctly, looks as intended (styling/layout), and behaves correctly (interactions) within the actual browser environment.
